We used many types of rendering our JSX, you can have a look at the code for that.
('||') Operator.
Map&Filter method for Conditional Lists.
We can prevent a component from rendering based on a condition if met, else return null.
('&&') Operator.
Ternary operation. isLoggedIn? (< A/>) : (< B/>)

For each component each will have props:onChange and value.
